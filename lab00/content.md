### Creating a Working Environment
In this section we'll install the tools required to run containers locally on the docker engine, as well as on minikube to better see container orchestration in action.

**Installing the Docker engine**
We'll install docker on OSX, however if you're running on another platform, please find the [installation instructions](http://docker.com/install) for your platform and install the proper binaries.


**Installing Virtualbox**
For these labs, we'll need Virtualbox installed. Minikube actually downloads a virtual machine that it runs in virtualbox, which makes the environment easy to manage.

If you don't have Virtualbox already installed, you can find the [installation guide](http://www.virtualbox.org) for your platform to get a current version of Virtualbox installed. The labs were tested on Virtualbox v5.1.30




**Installing minikube**




**Installing kubectl and setting the context**
